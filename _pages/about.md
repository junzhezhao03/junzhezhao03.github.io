I am Junzhe Zhao (赵俊喆), a first-year M.S. student in Operations Research at [The School of Management](https://en.business.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Lindong Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/ldliu/home). Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor of Management in 
Industrial Engineering at [Jiangnan University](https://english.jiangnan.edu.cn/).

My research interests mainly focus on cooperative games and combinatorial optimization.
